There are two folders within the "code" folder corresponding to two different codebases, python and abagail.

The python folder contains all of the jupyter notebook (and corresponding .py files) that can be used to run the
analysis work done for each of the experiemnts run in abagail. These files should be able to run by extracting all of
them into a directory and using python 3+ to run them. They will produce the graphs used in my PDF analysis.

All of the experiments done were done in the ABAGAIL framework. The first thing you'll need to do is download ABAGAIL and
follow the setup instructions. Then you can extract each of the files in the ABAGAIL folder into the following folder you
build your ABAGAIL project to
    - 'src/opt/test'

Each of these files are also standalone files so they can be run independently (as long as the datasource csv file is extracted
to the same location).
